# ASA.StatImplant
A mod for ARK: Survival Ascended that tracks your player's stats!

### Description
Adds a persistent implant to every players inventory that tracks their stats!
Upon dying, you can view the dead players implant in their inventory. However, this implant will be marked SHATTERED and will not track future stat changes of its original player. It just shows you the dead players stats at the time of their death.

### Stats Tracked
Currently tracked stats are:
  - Deaths
  - Total Kills
  - On-Foot Kills
  - On-Dino Kills
  - Long-Range Kills

But more are coming soon!
